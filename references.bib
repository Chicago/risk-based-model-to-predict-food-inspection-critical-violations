Data from a random 10 percent sample of restaurant inspection files from 31 counties in Oklahoma, including 4,044 inspections conducted during 1996-2000 in "medium-risk" and "bigh-risk" establishments, were analyzed to determine rates of critical violations and recurrent violations for different categories of estahlisbments. Repeat violations accounted for about half of all violations. Estahlisbments subjectively designated as high risk by healtb department personnel were in fact found to have higher violation rates than those described as medium-risk establishments. Outside Oklahoma County, regional cbain restaurants were significantly more likely than other restaurants to bave recurrent violations of critical items related to food-holding temperature, hygiene practices, sanitization, and hygiene facilities. Differences observed in violation rates among individual establishments were not primarily attributable to inconsistent enforcement by individual inspectors; rather, they appeared to be indicative of real differences in bygienic conditions and practices.},

	abstract = {The inspection of food facilities is a crucial public service designed to prevent foodborne illnesses among retail food consumers. To enhance the existing food inspection process in San Bernardino County, California, a risk-based food inspection program and assessment instrument has been developed and proposed. A literature review and interviews with health professionals were conducted to establish a baseline understanding of various inspection procedures currently being employed throughout the nation. San Bernardino subsequently developed an assessment instrument and attendant inspection schedules that reflect best practices. The proposed inspection model categorizes food facilities as high, moderate, or low risk according to food properties, service population characteristics, facility history, and predefined operational risks. The San Bernardino model supports health department decision making with respect to inspection resource allocation and also makes possible sliding permit fees that reflect the relative risk associated with each facility.},

A total of 326 restaurant inspection reports from 156 Asian restaurants in 10 Kansas counties were reviewed. Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated using SPSS. The findings of this study suggested the focus areas for food safety training in Asian restaurants: temperature control of PHF; employee personal hygiene; and employee hand washing practices. Also, our results indicated that behavior-related violations, especially behavior-related critical violations occurred more during the routine health inspection than other inspection types. In the future, researches could identify the effective ways to overcome barriers to food safety training in Asian restaurants. Through this investigation, Asian restaurant owners and managers may gain insights on what food handling practices related to code violations they should emphasize when training their employees.},

Nearly all respondents claimed that the standard of food hygiene was important to them when deciding where to eat out. Assessments of hygiene standards were mainly based on aesthetics. A minority had concerns/complaints about the hygiene standards of eating places they had used. People do not appear to be well informed about the role of the local authorities in protecting food safety and how the food safety laws are enforced. They believe that they have the right to know the result of a hygiene inspection. Half of them thought that it was difficult to find information on the hygiene standards of eating places. If access to information was easier, some consumers would eat out more often. The public will need to be educated on the inspection and enforcement process if 'scores on doors' is adopted as the main method of raising the confidence of the public in the standards of the food industry.},

	abstract = {The majority of local health departments perform routine restaurant inspections. In Los Angeles County (LAC), California, approximately \$10 million/year is spent on restaurant inspections. However, data are limited as to whether or not certain characteristics of restaurants make them more likely to be associated with foodborne incident reports. We used data from the LAC Environmental Health Management Information System (EHMIS), which records the results of all routine restaurant inspections as well as data regarding all consumer-generated foodborne incidents that led to a special restaurant inspection by a sanitarian (investigated foodborne incidents [IFBIs]). We analyzed a cohort of 10,267 restaurants inspected from 1 July 1997 to 15 November 1997. We defined a “case restaurant” as any restaurant with a routine inspection from 1 July 1997 to 15 November 1997 and a subsequent IFBI from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998. Noncase restaurants did not have an IFBI from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998. We looked for specific characteristics of restaurants that might be associated with the restaurant subsequently having an IFBI, including the size of restaurant (assessed by number of seats), any previous IFBIs, the overall inspection score, and a set of 38 violation codes. We identified 158 case restaurants and 10,109 noncase restaurants. In univariate analysis, middle-sized restaurants (61 to 150 seats; n = 1,681) were 2.8 times (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 2.0 to 4.0) and large restaurants ({\textgreater}150 seats; n = 621) were 4.6 times (95\% CI = 3.0 to 7.0) more likely than small restaurants (≤60 seats; n = 7,965) to become case restaurants. In addition, the likelihood of a restaurant becoming a case restaurant increased as the number of IFBIs in the prior year increased (χ2 for linear trend, P value = 0.0005). Other factors significantly associated with the occurrence of an IFBI included a lower overall inspection score, the incorrect storage of food, the reuse of food, the lack of employee hand washing, the lack of thermometers, and the presence of any food protection violation. In multivariate analysis, the size of restaurant, the incorrect storage of food, the reuse of food, and the presence of any food protection violation remained significant predictors for becoming a case restaurant. Our data suggest that routine restaurant inspections should concentrate on those establishments that have a large seating capacity or a poor inspection history. Evaluation of inspection data bases in individual local health departments and translation of those findings into inspection guidelines could lead to an increased efficiency and perhaps cost-effectiveness of local inspection programs.},

Regulatory attention tends to focus, at least initially, on high risks but low-risk regulatees or activities tend to form the bulk of the regulated population. This article asks why regulators need to address low risks and it outlines the potential difficulties that such risks present. It then considers how regulators tend to deal with lower risks in practice. A body of literature and survey-based research is used to develop a taxonomy of intervention strategies that may be useful in relation to low-risk activities, and, indeed, more widely. In an article to be published in the subsequent issue of this journal, we will then develop a strategic framework for regulators to employ when choosing intervention strategies and we will assesses whether, and how, such a framework could be used by regulatory agencies in a manner that is operable, dynamic, transparent, and justifiable.},

This reflects a convergence of increasing consumption of fresh produce, changes in production and distribution, and a growing awareness of the problem on the part of public health officials. The complex biology of pathogen contamination and survival on plant materials is beginning to be explained. Adhesion of pathogens to surfaces and internalization of pathogens limits the usefulness of conventional processing and chemical sanitizing methods in preventing transmission from contaminated produce. Better methods of preventing contamination on the farm, or during packing or processing, or use of a terminal control such as irradiation could reduce the burden of disease transmission from fresh produce. Outbreak investigations represent important opportunities to evaluate contamination at the farm level and along the farm-to-fork continuum. More complete and timely environmental assessments of these events and more research into the biology and ecology of pathogen-produce interactions are needed to identify better prevention strategies.},

As a case study, we turn to restaurant hygiene inspections – which are done for restaurants throughout the United States and in most of the world and are a frequently cited example of public inspections and disclosure. We present the first empirical study that shows the viability of statistical models that learn the mapping between textual signals in restaurant reviews and the hygiene inspection records from the Department of Public Health. The learned model achieves over 82\% accuracy in discriminating severe offenders from places with no violation, and provides insights into salient cues in reviews that are indicative of the restaurant’s sanitary conditions. Our study suggests that public disclosure policy can be improved by mining public opinions from social media to target inspections and to provide alternative forms of disclosure to customers.},

	abstract = {Computational approaches to health monitoring and epidemiology continue to evolve rapidly. We present an end-to-end system, nEmesis, that automatically identifies restaurants posing public health risks. Leveraging a language model of Twitter users' online communication, nEmesis finds individuals who are likely suffering from a foodborne illness. People's visits to restaurants are modeled by matching GPS data embedded in the messages with restaurant addresses. As a result, we can assign each venue a "health score" based on the proportion of customers that fell ill shortly after visiting it. Statistical analysis reveals that our inferred health score correlates ( r  = 0.30) with the official inspection data from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). We investigate the joint associations of multiple factors mined from online data with the DOHMH violation scores and find that over 23\% of variance can be explained by our factors. We demonstrate that readily accessible online data can be used to detect cases of foodborne illness in a timely manner. This approach offers an inexpensive way to enhance current methods to monitor food safety (e.g., adaptive inspections) and identify potentially problematic venues in near-real time.},

The purpose of the study reported here was to conduct an online survey of food safety professionals that would 1) identify the types of ethnic foods with which food safety professionals were unfamiliar and for which they lacked adequate food safety information, 2) describe ethnic-food safety concerns related to food establishments, and 3) describe the ethnic-food resources currently used by food safety professionals. The study found that food safety professionals throughout the United States encountered a variety of ethnic-food establishments and ethnic foods for which they lacked ethnic-food safety resources, especially at the local level. Therefore, it will be important to identify unsafe food-handling practices in ethnic-food establishments, develop science-based guidelines for ethnic-food safety inspections, and distribute culturally appropriate educational materials for ethnic-food safety inspections.},

In order to identify barriers to compliance, a research project was undertaken which identified 40 food retail businesses which had a record of nonconformance to acceptable food safety standards. These businesses were risk assessed by environmental health officers (EHOs) and given an appropriate category commensurate with their performance. Over a six month period the businesses were offered advice and cultural and communication issues were addressed. Seminars and one to one support were offered to the businesses. After a six month period a further risk assessment was undertaken. The results showed 26 (65\%) of businesses had improved their risk assessment, 6 (15\%) had remained the same, 4 (10\%) exhibited some deterioration in standards and 4 (10\%) had deteriorated a full category. In conclusion, the research recognizes that language difficulties and lack of knowledge and understanding of the principles of food safety are a major barrier to promoting food safety however when support is offered it can make a significant difference to working practices.},

In an attempt to relate the data collected during inspections in Minnesota to illness likelihood, data from routine inspections conducted at outbreak restaurants were compared with data from routine inspections conducted at nonoutbreak restaurants. The goal was to identify differences in recorded violations. Significantly more violations were recorded at restaurants that had outbreaks. The majority of these violations were related to contamination in the facility and environment and to food handling procedures. Relative risks also were calculated for violations significantly more likely to occur at locations that had outbreaks of norovirus infection, Clostridium perfringens infection or toxin-type illness, and Salmonella infection. These three pathogens are estimated to cause the majority of foodborne illnesses in the United States. Meta-analysis of composited data for the three pathogens revealed 11 violations significantly more likely (α {\textless} 0.05) to be identified during routine inspections at outbreak restaurants than during inspections at nonoutbreak restaurants. Application of this information permits assessment of health department inspection data in a consistent fashion. This approach can help identify criteria more likely to be associated with outbreak locations and allow operators to focus on interventions that will have the most significant impact in higher risk establishments.},

Two control restaurants with no reported outbreaks during this period were matched to each case restaurant on county health district and date of routine inspection (N = 56). Data from the routine inspection that preceded the outbreak (for case restaurants) or the date-matched routine inspection (for control restaurants) were abstracted from computerized inspection records. Case restaurants had a significantly lower mean inspection score (83.8 on a 0 to 100 point scale) than control restaurants (90.9). Restaurants with poor inspection scores and violations of proper temperature controls of potentially hazardous foods were, respectively, five and ten times more likely to have outbreaks than restaurants with better results. Although this study demonstrates that Seattle-King County's routine inspection form can successfully identify restaurants at increased risk of foodborne outbreaks, it also illustrates that more emphasis on regulation and education is needed to prevent outbreaks in restaurants with poor inspection results.},

High-risk food inspection premises were randomly assigned three, four, or five inspections per year. Results indicate that no statistical difference existed in outcome measures based on frequency of inspection. When premises were grouped based on the average time between inspections, premises with greater time between inspections scored better compliance measures relative to premises that were inspected more frequently.

	abstract = {Restaurants are important settings for foodborne disease transmission. The Environmental Health Specialists Network (EHS-Net) was established to identify underlying factors contributing to disease outbreaks and to translate those findings into improved prevention efforts. From June 2002 through June 2003, EHS-Net conducted systematic environmental evaluations in 22 restaurants in which outbreaks had occurred and 347 restaurants in which outbreaks had not occurred. Norovirus was the most common foodborne disease agent identified, accounting for 42\% of all confirmed foodborne outbreaks during the study period. Handling of food by an infected person or carrier (65\%) and bare-hand contact with food (35\%) were the most commonly identified contributing factors. Outbreak and nonoutbreak restaurants were similar with respect to many characteristics. The major difference was in the presence of a certified kitchen manager (CKM); 32\% of outbreak restaurants had a CKM, but 71\% of nonoutbreak restaurants had a CKM (odds ratio of 0.2; 95\% confidence interval of 0.1 to 0.5). CKMs were associated with the absence of bare-hand contact with foods as a contributing factor, fewer norovirus outbreaks, and the absence of outbreaks associated with Clostridium perfringens. However, neither the presence of a CKM nor the presence of policies regarding employee health significantly affected the identification of an infected person or carrier as a contributing factor. These findings suggest a lack of effective monitoring of employee illness or a lack of commitment to enforcing policies regarding ill food workers. Food safety certification of kitchen managers appears to be an important outbreak prevention measure, and managing food worker illnesses should be emphasized during food safety training programs.},

	abstract = {In this article we estimate the annual cost of illness and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) loss in the United States caused by 14 of the 31 major foodborne pathogens reported on by Scallan et al. (Emerg. Infect. Dis. 17:7–15, 2011), based on their incidence estimates of foodborne illness in the United States. These 14 pathogens account for 95\% of illnesses and hospitalizations and 98\% of deaths due to identifiable pathogens estimated by Scallan et al. We estimate that these 14 pathogens cause \$14.0 billion (ranging from \$4.4 billion to \$33.0 billion) in cost of illness and a loss of 61,000 QALYs (ranging from 19,000 to 145,000 QALYs) per year. Roughly 90\% of this loss is caused by five pathogens: nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica (\$3.3 billion; 17,000 QALYs), Campylobacter spp. (\$1.7 billion; 13,300 QALYs), Listeria monocytogenes (\$2.6 billion; 9,400 QALYs), Toxoplasma gondii (\$3 billion; 11,000 QALYs), and norovirus (\$2 billion; 5,000 QALYs). A companion article attributes losses estimated in this study to the consumption of specific categories of foods. To arrive at these estimates, for each pathogen we create disease outcome trees that characterize the symptoms, severities, durations, outcomes, and likelihoods of health states associated with that pathogen. We then estimate the cost of illness (medical costs, productivity loss, and valuation of premature mortality) for each pathogen. We also estimate QALY loss for each health state associated with a given pathogen, using the EuroQol 5D scale. Construction of disease outcome trees, outcome-specific cost of illness, and EuroQol 5D scoring are described in greater detail in a second companion article.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Foodborne illness is an important contributor to morbidity and health system costs in Canada. Using number of critical hazards as a proxy for food safety, we sought to better understand how to improve food safety in restaurants. We compared the current standard of annual inspections to twice-yearly inspections among restaurants "at risk" for food safety infractions. These were restaurants that had three or more elevated-risk inspection ratings in the preceding 36 months.
METHODS: We conducted a two-arm randomized controlled trial between November 2012 and October 2014. The intervention was twice-yearly routine restaurant inspection compared to standard once-yearly routine inspection. Included were all restaurants within Saskatoon Health Region that were assessed as "at risk", with 73 restaurants in the intervention arm and 78 in the control arm. Independent sample t-tests were conducted between groups to compare: i) average number of critical hazards per inspection; and ii) proportion of inspections resulting in a rating indicating an elevated hazard.
RESULTS: Over time we noted statistically significant improvements across both study arms, in number of both critical food safety hazards (decreased by 61\%) and elevated-risk inspection ratings (decreased by 45\%) (p \&lt; 0.0001). We observed no significant differences between the two groups pre- or post-intervention.
CONCLUSION: Results suggest increasing the number of annual routine inspections in high-risk restaurants was not associated with a significant difference in measures of compliance with food safety regulations. Findings of this study do not provide evidence supporting increased frequency of restaurant inspection from annually to twice annually.},

	abstract = {There are an estimated 48 million cases of foodborne illness per annum in the United States, with a majority of the illnesses associated with eating in a restaurant. Previous research into the causes of foodborne illness have primarily focused on factors that are internal to the restaurant. This research examines both internal components as well as external factors from the surrounding community that could influence how a food establishment operates. Inspection data, providing the basis for this analysis, came from routine inspection reports from Maricopa County, Arizona and the State of Florida. Additional evaluations are from randomly sampled restaurants, containing information on the occurrence of specific risk factors for foodborne illness, captured from States A and B. External community demographic data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey was also used. The routine inspection data was analyzed using a general estimating equations approach, and the risk factor study data was analyzed via a tobit regression. This approach allowed for the identification of the specific variables and their relative effect on the food safety performance of the establishment The only external factor to have an influence on restaurant food safety performance was the level of market competition, both near the restaurant and at a further distance from the restaurant. Other socio-demographic variables of the area were not found to have a significant effect. Internal factors, such as the level of food-handling and the food-safety related training held by employees were found to have an effect on the restaurants food safety performance. This study has shown the utility in assessing the compliance status of each risk factor, and the limitations of only using a count of violations. Additionally, concordant with most facilities operating in a sanitary manner, large sample sizes are required to identify an effect from a covariate.},

	abstract = {Public health is expected to be adversely affected by climate change. One aspect is rising temperatures that will directly and indirectly impact the biological mechanisms that propagate the spread of disease. Future summer heat waves are projected to increase in frequency, intensity, and duration, reaching historic temperatures by the end of the century. While previous studies have found links between increased ambient temperatures and increased cases of foodborne illness, the role of critical temperature violations in retail food facilities has not been clearly established. Improper hot and cold holding temperatures of potentially hazardous foods is one of the 5 major predictors of foodborne illness according to the CDC.  In this study the association between daily maximum temperatures over the 2 year study period of 2013-2014 and holding temperature violations was examined. Inspection and violation data for the 2-year period was obtained from the County of San Diego�s Department of Environmental Health. When rates of temperature violations were examined, days with maximum temperatures greater or equal to 20�C, 25�C, and 30�C were associated with higher rates of violations (p{\textless}0.05). In analysis by season, the combined summer months of June, July, and August had significantly higher rates of temperature violations per inspection in comparison to the remaining months of the year (p{\textless}0.001). As San Diego has episodes of extreme hot weather (e.g. Santa Ana winds) in winter months as well, an analysis was conducted to determine if unusually hot days (as compared to the historical average maximum temperature) of the 2 study years were associated with a greater rate of violations, however, no association was found. In a nation where restaurants play a large role in consumer culture, environmental changes impacting food safety maintenance of retail food facilities have the potential to adversely affect the state of public health. This study, while being limited in a the lack of a direct assessment of cold holding temperature violations, suggests that future efforts should be focused on increased surveillance and better monitoring of food-handling practices that prevent the propagation of diseases attributed to retail food facilities affected by the changing state of the environment.},

	abstract = {Foodborne illness (FBI) is a preventable economic and public health burden yet continues to be a major problem in the United States. It is estimated that 48 million FBI cases occur each year. Routine inspections of food facilities conducted by public health inspectors are the principal method for ensuring food safety, and through these inspections data is routinely collected. Analysis of these inspections may produce information useful in targeting prevention efforts. The objective of this study was to determine the characteristics of food facilities that are associated with food safety violations, especially facility size and risk level. Retrospective routine inspection data for the years 2013 and 2014 from the San Diego County Department of Environmental Health was examined A total of 43,194 inspections were conducted during this time which resulted in 112,145 violations. The predictors examined were business types, facility size, and facility risk classification to determine association with violation frequencies. The violations from this data were also analyzed in comparison to the top five Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) risk factors for FBI. Compared to the other facilities, restaurants had a higher frequency of violations than expected for four out of the five CDC risk factors which included improper hot/cold holding temperatures, improper cooking temperatures, dirty and/or contaminated utensils and equipment, and poor employee health and hygiene. Miscellaneous food facilities, pre-packaged retail market, and retail market with deli all had higher frequency of food from unsafe sources than expected. By size, small sized facilities in the medium-risk category had a higher frequency than expected for improper hot and cold holding temperatures of potentially hazardous food and poor employee health and hygiene. High-risk facilities were more likely to be ordered closed or have major violations. More than half of all facilities (60.7\%) were repeat violators ({\textgreater}1 violation per unique inspection). This data indicates that medium-risk small sized facilities should potentially be a target for FBI outreach and prevention efforts, as well as continuing efforts directed towards high-risk facilities, especially restaurants.},

	abstract = {Foodborne illness is prevented by inspection and surveillance conducted by health departments across America. Appropriate restaurant behavior is enforced and monitored via public health inspections. However, surveillance coverage provided by state and local health departments is insufficient in preventing the rising number of foodborne illness outbreaks. To address this need for improved surveillance coverage we conducted a supplementary form of public health surveillance using social media data: Yelp.com restaurant reviews in the city of San Francisco. Yelp is a social media site where users post reviews and rate restaurants they have personally visited. Presence of keywords related to health code regulations and foodborne illness symptoms, number of restaurant reviews, number of Yelp stars, and restaurant price range were included in a model predicting a restaurant’s likelihood of health code violation measured by the assigned San Francisco public health code rating. For a list of major health code violations see (S1 Table). We built the predictive model using 71,360 Yelp reviews of restaurants in the San Francisco Bay Area. The predictive model was able to predict health code violations in 78\% of the restaurants receiving serious citations in our pilot study of 440 restaurants. Training and validation data sets each pulled data from 220 restaurants in San Francisco. Keyword analysis of free text within Yelp not only improved detection of high-risk restaurants, but it also served to identify specific risk factors related to health code violation. To further validate our model we applied the model generated in our pilot study to Yelp data from 1,542 restaurants in San Francisco. The model achieved 91\% sensitivity 74\% specificity, area under the receiver operator curve of 98\%, and positive predictive value of 29\% (given a substandard health code rating prevalence of 10\%). When our model was applied to restaurant reviews in New York City we achieved 74\% sensitivity, 54\% specificity, area under the receiver operator curve of 77\%, and positive predictive value of 25\% (given a prevalence of 12\%). Model accuracy improved when reviews ranked highest by Yelp were utilized. Our results indicate that public health surveillance can be improved by using social media data to identify restaurants at high risk for health code violation. Additionally, using highly ranked Yelp reviews improves predictive power and limits the number of reviews needed to generate prediction. Use of this approach as an adjunct to current risk ranking of restaurants prior to inspection may enhance detection of those restaurants participating in high risk practices that may have gone previously undetected. This model represents a step forward in the integration of social media into meaningful public health interventions.},
