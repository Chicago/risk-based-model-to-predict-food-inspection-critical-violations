	title = {Food Safety Training Needed for Asian Restaurants: Longitudinal Review of Health Inspection Data in Kansas},
	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess the frequencies and types of food code violations at Asian restaurants in Kansas using longitudinal review of health inspection data. A total of 326 restaurant inspection reports from 156 Asian restaurants in 10 Kansas counties were reviewed. Descriptive and inferential statistics were calculated using {SPSS}. The findings of this study suggested the focus areas for food safety training in Asian restaurants: temperature control of {PHF}; employee personal hygiene; and employee hand washing practices. Also, our results indicated that behavior-related violations, especially behavior-related critical violations occurred more during the routine health inspection than other inspection types. In the future, researches could identify the effective ways to overcome barriers to food safety training in Asian restaurants. Through this investigation, Asian restaurant owners and managers may gain insights on what food handling practices related to code violations they should emphasize when training their employees.},

	abstract = {Records of restaurant inspections by public healtb departments provide sequential "snapshots" of conditions in retail food service establishments that can be used to identil)' risk factors and evaluate the effectiveness
of interventions. Data from a random 10 percent sample of restaurant inspection files from 31 counties in Oklahoma, including 4,044 inspections conducted during 1996-2000 in "medium-risk" and "bigh-risk" establishments, were analyzed to determine rates of critical violations and recurrent violations for different categories of estahlisbments. Repeat violations accounted for about half of all violations. Estahlisbments subjectively designated as high risk by healtb department personnel were in fact found to have higher violation rates than those described as medium-risk establishments. Outside Oklahoma County, regional cbain restaurants were significantly more likely than other restaurants to bave recurrent violations of critical items related to food-holding temperature, hygiene practices, sanitization, and hygiene facilities. Differences observed in violation rates among individual establishments were not primarily attributable to inconsistent enforcement by individual inspectors; rather, they appeared to be indicative of real differences in bygienic conditions and practices.},

	title = {A Risk-Based Food Inspection Program},
	volume = {69},
	abstract = {The inspection of food facilities is a crucial public service designed to prevent foodborne illnesses among retail food consumers. To enhance the existing food inspection process in San Bernardino County, California, a risk-based food inspection program and assessment instrument has been developed and proposed. A literature review and interviews with health professionals were conducted to establish a baseline understanding of various inspection procedures currently being employed throughout the nation. San Bernardino subsequently developed an assessment instrument and attendant inspection schedules that reflect best practices. The proposed inspection model categorizes food facilities as high, moderate, or low risk according to food properties, service population characteristics, facility history, and predefined operational risks. The San Bernardino model supports health department decision making with respect to inspection resource allocation and also makes possible sliding permit fees that reflect the relative risk associated with each facility.},

The models include linear regression, two-class logistic regression, and multinomial regression problems while the penalties include ℓ1 (the lasso), ℓ2 (ridge regression) and mixtures of the two (the elastic net). The algorithms use cyclical coordinate descent, computed along a regularization path. The methods can handle large problems and can also deal efficiently with sparse features. In comparative timings we find that the new algorithms are considerably faster than competing methods.},
